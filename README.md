# AI Workflow Templates

Proven AI-powered workflows for faster development & better results.

## What's Inside

### Architect/Implementer Workflow (`CLAUDE.md`)

A battle-tested methodology for using AI coding agents effectively, based on Jesse Vincent's approach & popularized by Simon Willison.

**Key Concept:** Separate design from implementation using multiple AI sessions & written plans.

**Why This Works:**
- 50%+ reduction in review burden
- Run 2-3+ parallel features without confusion
- Eliminates "why did you do it that way?" questions
- Creates reusable plan templates

## Quick Start

1. **Read the methodology**: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)
2. **Create your first plan**: Use the brainstorming prompt to design a feature
3. **Execute in parallel**: Spin up implementer sessions to build it
4. **Review & iterate**: Architect reviews, implementer fixes

## The Four Core Prompts

### 1. Brainstorming (Architect Session)
Ask AI to help you turn an idea into a fully-formed design & spec through iterative questions.

### 2. Planning (Architect Session)
Convert the design into a comprehensive implementation plan with bite-sized tasks, file paths, & testing approach.

### 3. Implementation (New Session)
Fresh AI session reads the plan & executes tasks in 3-4 task chunks.

### 4. Review (Architect Session)
Original architect reviews implementer's work for spec adherence, test quality, & design alignment.

## Real-World Results

- **Time to implementation**: Weeks → Hours
- **Parallel features**: 1 → 3-4 simultaneously
- **Context switching**: Eliminated (each session has clean context)
- **Review time**: Cut by 50%+

## Use Cases

- Complex multi-step features
- Parallel development of independent features
- Large refactors broken into phases
- Research → prototype workflows
